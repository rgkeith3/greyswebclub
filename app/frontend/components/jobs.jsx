    <p>Well, I wish I could hire you, but truth is, I myself am looking for a job. So if you are looking for a full-stack or front-end developer who has an eye for design, is a CSS wizard, knows React like the back of his hand, is a JavaScript whisperer and only wears tiki shirts, then I'm your guy.</p>
    <p>Check out my personal <a href="https://www.greysweb.site">site</a></p>
    <p>pls hire me!</p>
