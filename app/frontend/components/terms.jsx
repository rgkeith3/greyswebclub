    <p>Ah, I see you've found our Terms of Service. Well, against the wishes of my lawyer, Grey's Web Club has no ToS. Just use the site how you will, and try not to be mean.</p>
    <p>Actually, I take it back, these are the Terms of Service for the Web Club</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Don't be mean.</li>
      <li>Love your neighbor's content.</li>
      <li>Be sure to like and subscribe.</li>
      <li>Have fun!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Alright, enough talk, get out there and share content with fellow club members!</p>
